# WEB SCRAPING

## INTRODUCTION
This is Task 6 Submission by Team B of the HNG Internship 6.0, Machine Learning Track. We were assigned to use a web scraping tool like Selenium to get the H-index, names and other informations of Computer Science professors on Google Scholar(Page 1 - 25)

## Getting Started



1. Have a chromedriver in the same directory as your .py file
2. Make sure you have google chrome on ur PC
3. Let the chrome version and chromedriver version match
4. Run the code with any python compatible text editor
5. The last line of the .py file specifies the  csv file name, you should rename it
   to avoid the existence of duplicate files
6. Please wait patiently for the code to finish running, the reason for the delay is
   because google will flag it if delay is not put in place. If it doesn't stop by 
   itself the code is still running so wait.
7. Sometimes a fluctuating network might cause a break in code so if it's stuck at a
   point for too long you can refresh the browser
